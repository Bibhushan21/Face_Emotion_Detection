# Face and Emotion Detection

This project utilizes computer vision techniques to detect faces in real-time and analyze their emotions using the FER (Facial Expression Recognition) library. It captures video input from a webcam and displays the detected emotions alongside the faces.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The application processes video frames from the webcam, detects faces, and identifies the dominant emotion for each detected face. The results are displayed in real time, providing immediate feedback on the emotional state of individuals in the frame.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV (for video capture and image processing)
  - Numpy (for numerical operations)
  - FER (for emotion detection)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

1. **Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy fer


## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `face_emotion_detection.py` file to start the application.
